Below is an in‐depth, step‐by‐step “master solution” outline presented as a series of bullet points. This solution is designed to meet (and exceed) the COMP0239 coursework requirements by building a robust distributed data analysis service that uses a pre-existing predictive method. Each major phase is broken down into actionable steps in chronological order.

1. Requirements Analysis & Planning
Review Coursework Brief Thoroughly
Understand the need for a distributed data analysis service, capacity testing (24 hours continuous load), and the use of a pre-existing predictive model.
Identify the roles of the host (CNC) and 4 worker machines.
Define Project Scope and Success Criteria
Ensure that the system allows users to submit new datasets without coding.
Determine metrics for performance: throughput, resource usage, job concurrency, and capacity thresholds.
Set Milestones & Deliverables
Architecture design documentation
Implementation of the distributed service with monitoring
A working prototype on cloud machines with installation instructions
Detailed report (max 4,000 words) and a link to the GitHub repository
2. Infrastructure Setup & Environment Preparation
Provision Cloud Machines
Allocate the 5 machines as specified:
1 Host (2 cores, 4GB RAM, 10GB HDD)
4 Workers (each with 4 cores, 32GB RAM, 50GB – expandable up to 200GB HDD)
Operating System and Security
Install a consistent OS (e.g., Ubuntu LTS) on all machines.
Configure SSH keys and the lecture key for seamless inter-machine access.
Install Core Software Components
Set up containerization (Docker) or use virtual environments to ensure reproducibility.
Install prerequisite libraries (Python, Java, etc.), distributed frameworks, and monitoring tools.
3. Selection of Distributed Framework & Predictive Tool
Choose the Distributed Computing Framework
Evaluate options such as Apache Spark, Hadoop MapReduce, or Celery/MPI.
Recommendation: Use Apache Spark for its robust ML library (MLlib) and ease of scaling across multiple nodes.
Select the Pre-Existing Predictive Method
Pick an established machine learning/statistical algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or SVM).
Note: Ensure the algorithm is available both in Spark’s MLlib and as a well-tested option in scikit-learn if needed.
Identify a Suitable Dataset
Explore repositories such as UCI, Kaggle, or the datasets mentioned in the brief.
Criteria: The dataset should be “sufficiently large” or can be synthetically scaled to ensure the processing takes at least 24 hours under capacity conditions.
4. System Architecture Design & Pipeline Development
Architectural Overview
Control Plane: A host node that coordinates job scheduling, monitoring, and user interfaces.
Worker Nodes: Responsible for distributed data processing using Spark jobs.
Storage & Data Flow: Use a distributed file system (e.g., HDFS or cloud storage) for input and output datasets.
Design the Analysis Pipeline
Data Ingestion: Write modules to load and pre-process incoming data.
Distributed Processing: Implement the predictive task as a Spark job using the selected predictive model.
Result Aggregation: Collect and store the model’s outputs to a centralized repository for user retrieval.
Workflow & Abstraction Layers
Create a workflow orchestration layer (using Apache Airflow or custom scripts) to chain tasks:
Data validation → Preprocessing → Model inference → Post-processing and result storage.
5. Implementation & Coding
Setup the Distributed Computing Cluster
Configure Apache Spark on the host and worker nodes.
Ensure proper network communication and resource allocation.
Develop the Predictive Pipeline Code
Write Spark jobs using PySpark or Scala:
Define input data transformations.
Integrate the selected predictive algorithm from MLlib.
Optimize the job for parallel execution.
Automate Deployment
Create scripts (Bash, Ansible, or Docker Compose) to automatically install and configure the system on a fresh set of machines.
Ensure that the installation instructions in the GitHub repository are clear and reproducible.
6. Monitoring, Benchmarking & Performance Optimization
Implement System Monitoring
Hardware Monitoring: Deploy tools like Prometheus (for metrics collection) and Grafana (for visualization) to track CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network usage on all nodes.
Job Monitoring: Integrate logging and alerting within the Spark jobs to capture performance data such as job duration, task failures, and throughput.
Benchmarking the Service
Develop a capacity testing script that:
Submits jobs continuously over a 24-hour period.
Varies load to identify the saturation point where throughput begins to drop.
Record detailed metrics:
Maximum throughput (jobs per time unit)
Concurrent job handling capability
Resource consumption per job and overall system performance
Performance Tuning
Analyze monitoring data to determine bottlenecks (e.g., load average spikes, disk I/O limits).
Experiment with configuration options (e.g., Spark executor memory, worker thread count) and document improvements.
Propose further configuration changes (e.g., optimizing network communication, scaling out with caching) for capacity enhancement.
7. User Interface for Data Submission & Retrieval
Develop a Simple Submission Interface
Create a web-based dashboard or RESTful API allowing users to:
Upload new input datasets.
Select the predefined analysis pipeline.
Ensure the UI requires no code modification on the user’s side.
Result Retrieval Mechanism
Build an output retrieval system:
Provide a unique job ID on submission.
Allow users to query job status and download processed results.
Optionally, incorporate notifications (email or webhooks) upon job completion.
8. Testing, Documentation & Reporting
Comprehensive Testing
Conduct unit tests and integration tests for each module (data ingestion, processing, output retrieval).
Simulate failure scenarios (e.g., node downtime) to validate system resilience.
Capacity Test Execution
Run the full pipeline continuously for 24 hours.
Capture and analyze performance metrics; document the stress test environment and results.
Documentation & Final Report
Write a concise report (within 4,000 words) including:
An explanation of the predictive analysis task and the chosen model.
A detailed description of the system architecture and pipeline implementation.
A full account of the capacity testing results, including throughput, concurrent job capacity, resource usage, and identified bottlenecks.
A discussion of possible improvements and configuration options.
Provide a link to a GitHub repository containing:
The full source code.
Automated setup instructions for a fresh installation.
Detailed user guides for both system administrators and end users.
9. Final Review & Submission
Internal Peer Review
Test the installation on a fresh set of machines to ensure reproducibility.
Validate that all documentation, scripts, and the UI operate as expected.
Submit Before Deadline
Ensure the complete project (code, report, and live system access) is submitted before 16:00 (UK time) on 28/04/2025.
Verify that the infrastructure is accessible via the lecture key as required.
